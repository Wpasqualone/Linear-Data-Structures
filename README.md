# Linear-Data-Structures
The excersises from Week 11- Linear Data Structures


1. A linked list is one kinda of list used to sort data. One solution it is very helpful for is things where you need to be frequently looking at the first or last items. 
  Since it has the first and last items stored explicitly logged, it can very quickly access these. 
  
2. The difference between a stack and queue is which items get processed first. In a queue, the first item to be entered is also the first to be removed and processed. 
    In a stack, the last ite, to be entered is the first to be removed and processed.
    
3. Stacks are useful for coding solutions to many different problems. The main reason one would use a stack is when the last item is the most relevant.
   Since stacks make accessing the last item in the list very easy, applications where the last/most recent item is alwyas the next that needs to be process benefit from using stacks.

4. An Array is similar to a list, but is slightly different. While a list in C# always has a data type associated with it. Arrays, on the other hand, can store any kind of data
   This can come in handy when you are unsure what kind of data will be inputted.
